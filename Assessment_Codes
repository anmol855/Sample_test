Part One:Setting up Postgres in a docker container by following commands as shown:

C:\Users\DELL G7>docker pull postgres:alphine 

followed by

C:\Users\DELL G7>docker images

followed by 

C:\Users\DELL G7>docker run --name postgres-0 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:alpine 

followed by 

postgres=# create database test1;

and output would be:
CREATE DATABASE 

followed by:
postgres=# \c test 


Now we will import dataset in form of csv into postgresql by following command:

The commands for the same are:

CREATE TABLE Public."anime1"(anime_id INT PRIMARY KEY,title TEXT);
select * from Public."anime1"

COPY PUBLIC ."anime1" FROM 'C:\Users\DELL G7\Downloads\data1 - DATA (1).csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;


Part Two: Settig up Jupyter in another docker container

docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work jupyter/scipy-notebook
(It would start  Pulling from jupyter/scipy-notebook ).

showing : Status: Downloaded newer image for jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest 



and finally to run jupyter notebook with help of docker,the following command is to be used:
docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/minimal-notebook 
Prior to that,links would be generated for accesing that jupyter file in browser.
